OsEID  20210701 (released)
Author: Peter Popovec <popovec.peter@gmail.com>
Date: Thu Jul  1 10:39:27 CEST 2021

	* AES/DES fully compatible with MyEID 4.5.5 (AES-ECB/CBC/CBC-PAD)
	* key wrap/unwrap improved
	* modular multiplicative inversion - AVR-ASM code
	* T1 protocol for AVR128DA32 based device

OsEID  20201130 (released)
Author: Peter Popovec <popovec.peter@gmail.com>
Date: Mon Nov 30 13:45:32 CET 2020

	* New hardware - AVR128DA32
	* card serial number derived from MCU serial number (AVR128DA, Xmega)
	* communication speed up to 312kbit
	* about 2x faster crypto function
	* class A,B,C support (1.8 to 5.5V)
	* ECC - fast reduction improved (moved from C to ASM)

OsEID  20190830 (released)
Author: Peter Popovec <popovec.peter@gmail.com>
Date: Mon 30 Sep 2019 08:47:21 CEST 2019

	* RSA improved (speed up about 10%)
	* APDU chaining (for security operation decrypt/sign, key upload)
	* extended APDU support (partial, PSO and PUT DATA can handle Lc > 255)
	* Ne/Le handling in T1 protocol
	* support for 256 byte transfer in read binary (Case 2S from ISO7816-3)
	* RSA generate key fixed (P,Q too close)
	* AVR 256 bit multiplication, fixed error in carry propagation
         (swapped carry in bytes 57,56 of result)
	* DES 56 bits key support (56,64,128,192)
	* MyEID compatibility: security operation does not depend
          on current selected file.
	* unwrap generic secret or AES key by RSA key (experimental)
